"""Image URL-reference derivation service (§T119; ADR 0008).

The single home (§V37) for turning an already-stored ``game_id`` into a query-time
image URL that points at the ``yuanyan3060/ArknightsGameResource`` raw-GitHub mirror.

Two invariants hold **by construction** here:

* **DERIVE, don't store (§V63).** Every function is a pure string builder over a
  ``game_id`` the database already holds (``operators.game_id`` → portrait/avatar/skin,
  ``enemies.game_id`` → enemy). No URL and no byte is ever persisted; takedown is a
  config flip with nothing to purge.
* **Never fetch (§V1/§V24).** The derived URL is an opaque emit string. This module
  performs no HEAD/GET/existence-check/validation -- not at import, not at query time.
  It imports no network library. A dead link is the client's to discover; the server
  never turns one into an error or a fallback download.

The emission gate lives in configuration, not here: :func:`arknights_mcp` config's
``AppConfig.image_refs_enabled`` is ON by default (§T124, founder 2026-07-22). As of ADR
0009 the gate carries no deployment-posture term -- "private" means access-controlled, not
loopback-only, since §V9 already fails startup closed on any anonymous non-loopback
surface, so an authenticated (OIDC/bearer) deployment may emit references (§C/D4). The
tool wiring (§T120) additionally requires the ``arknights_game_resource`` source to be
enabled in the registry (§V20 kill switch) before attaching any of these URLs. Deriving
a URL is free of side effects, so these functions are always safe to call; whether the
result is *emitted* is decided upstream.

Shape verified against the live repo tree (branch ``main``, 2026-07-22; §V63/ADR 0008):

* base   ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuanyan3060/ArknightsGameResource/main/<folder>/<file>.png``
* portrait ``portrait/<game_id>_1.png`` (E0), ``portrait/<game_id>_2.png`` (E2)
* avatar   ``avatar/<game_id>.png`` (base), ``avatar/<game_id>_2.png`` (E2)
* skin     ``skin/<game_id>_1b.png`` (E0 full illustration), ``skin/<game_id>_2b.png`` (E2)
* enemy    ``enemy/<game_id>.png`` (base)

Base ids never contain ``#``/``+``, but skin-variant filenames can, so the derivation
percent-encodes ``#``→``%23`` and ``+``→``%2B`` **unconditionally** (§V63) -- one
encoder, applied the same way to every derived URL.
