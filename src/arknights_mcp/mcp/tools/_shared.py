"""Shared plumbing for the MCP tool handlers (§V37 single home).

Every ``get_*`` / ``search_*`` tool follows the same read-only shape: acquire the
process-wide connection, run a domain service, and map the outcome to a typed
:class:`~arknights_mcp.mcp.envelopes.ResponseEnvelope` (§V23). The
acquisition + fail-closed error handling is identical across tools, so it lives
here once rather than being copy-pasted into each tool module (§V37):

* a :class:`~arknights_mcp.db.connection.DatabaseUnavailable` fails closed to a
  fixed ``database_unavailable`` envelope;
* any other exception fails closed to ``internal_error`` -- never a leaked
  exception text, stack trace, or local path (§V23).

Only the per-tool *shaping* of a successful domain result differs; that stays in
the owning tool module and is passed in as ``shape``.
