"""``get_stage_drops`` + ``get_item_drops`` MCP tools (§T91/§T104; §V5/§V53/§V54/§V60; §I.tool).

Both tools bridge a bounded input model (§T30) to a shared
:mod:`~arknights_mcp.services.drops` service (§V14) and wrap the outcome in the
typed :class:`~arknights_mcp.mcp.envelopes.ResponseEnvelope` (§T29). The two are
mirror images over the same penguin drop-rate cache: ``get_stage_drops`` lists one
stage's drops, ``get_item_drops`` compares one item across the stages that drop it
(the §V60 reverse view). Neither owns query logic -- only the model -> service ->
envelope mapping -- so both transports dispatch identical read-only (§V2) behaviour
from the single registry, and neither fetches penguin at query time (§V52/§V1);
they only read the promoted cache. They live in one module (§V37/§V38) since they
share the penguin provenance/expiry wire shaping.

The load-bearing invariants for both:

* **§V5** -- ``server`` is required, so every delivered fact is region-attributed +
  carries provenance; en/cn are never silently mixed.
* **§V53/§V54** -- each drop carries the penguin ``snapshot_id`` + ``fetched_at`` +
  ``expires_at`` (its OWN provenance chain, distinct from the game-data fact); a
  drop served past ``expires_at`` flips the status to ``data_stale`` and adds a
  staleness limitation -- never presented as fresh.
* **§V55/§V60/§V66.1** -- ``include_efficiency`` surfaces a SINGLE deterministic
  ranked farming observation (§T129): the §V6 fields (rule_id + confidence +
  analyzer_version) are stated once at the observation level and the per-entity data
  lives in ``ranking`` rows ``{id, name, sanity_per_item}`` whose ``id`` references
  the sibling drops/stages facts (evidence by reference, never re-copied numbers).
  ``get_item_drops`` ranks the rows ascending by sanity per item (§V60) with the
  mandatory availability/first-clear/byproduct caveats on the observation, an ordering
  + evidence never a best-farm/mandatory verdict (§V7). A per-row confidence +
  limitation appears only where a row deviates (thin sample / expired); an expired
  cache downgrades that row below the §V8 threshold, never a fresh recommendation.
* **§V23** -- every result is a typed-status envelope; a database failure or any
  unexpected error fails closed to a fixed, path/trace-free envelope via the
  shared :func:`~arknights_mcp.mcp.tools._shared.run_guarded` guard.
